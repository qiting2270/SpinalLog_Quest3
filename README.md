## Overview
Back pain is a widespread health issue, with chronic cases significantly impacting daily activities and affecting a substantial portion of the population. Physiotherapists play a crucial role to alleviate this ailment. However their education is not always optimal. Traditional physiotherapy education is constrained by inability to mimic the conditions of real patients and limited visual feedback for spinal mobilisation. To enhance training, we developed a mixed reality (MR) application intended to work with physical simulator devices, SpinalLog and vARtebra, using Unity engine and Meta Quest 3. This application offers real-time visual and haptic feedback of bone activities on applied force, enabling realistic spinal mobilisation for physiotherapy training. A user evaluation with physiotherapy experts and students provided positive and useful feedback, validating the effectiveness of this application and highlighting the potential to improve the functionality accuracy and user experience of the system. Future work will focus on streamlining calibration, enhancing sensory feedback, expanding functionality for more comprehensive and immersive training experience, and validate short and long term learning effects.
